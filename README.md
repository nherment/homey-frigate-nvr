# Homey Frigate

Frigate NVR integration for Homey

Gotchas:
- Renaming a camera in Frigate will make it permanently unavailable in Homey
- The MQTT username and password used by Homey are the same as Frigate. It is possible to update the MQTT username and passwords independently for each camera.
- Images generated by triggers are only available for 5 minutes and then are unregistered
